# World generation using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm

## Project work for the course TNM084 Procedural Images

## **What is this?**

This is a project demonstrating the use of the constraint-based algorithm WFC written in Javascript in combination with Three.js to generate a procedural slice of a world.

## **Sounds cool! How do I try this out?**

Just clone this project, and run the *index.html*-file through some kind of local development server. (Live server for VSCode does wonders for me, but any will do fine.) Just beware that in it's current state, the application is slightly GPU-intensive.

## **Credits**

Thanks to [Maxim Gumin](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) for creating the WFC algorithm and [Sketchpunk](https://codepen.io/sketchpunk/pen/oNjwvbM) for your adaptation to Javascript.
